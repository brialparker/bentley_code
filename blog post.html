<h4>unfinished -- likely will end up using a different test example than date normalization</h4>


<p>Hello! Walker the Intern here. Today's post will [...]</p>

<h4>Test-driven development - what is it?</h4>

<h4>How does that possibly apply to archives?</h4>

<h4>What about the overhead?</h4>

<p>The Bentley's EADs cover over 80 years of changing descriptive practice, and represent literally thousands of hours of work on the part of the staff and students who were involved in their creation. The last thing we want to do while automating our xml normalizations is make an unintended change that nullifies the work of those who came before us. Unfortunately, uncertainty is always a factor when working with messy data. [more about small changes having unintended effects]<p>

<p>The solution outlined here is a practice that is nearly ubiquitously adopted in the world of software development, especially those that follow agile development methods, and when applied properly [...]</p>

<p>Even if you're not familiar with programming languages, python is unusually readable, so follow along and I think you'll be surprised at how much it makes sense!</p>

<p>The mantra of TDD: test first, then code. So, let's make a new file to hold all our test code (we'll call it test_date_normalizer.py) and start writing:</p>

<pre class="brush: python; toolbar: false">
# first, we'll define the original input text, something we
# might find in an average EAD &lt;unitdate&gt; tag,
# then the text we want to transform the original into
date_text_raw = "July 1, 2014"
date_text_standard = "2014-07-01" 

# run the (currently unwritten) code to transform the input text,
# and store the result in a new variable
normalized_date_text = normalize_date(date_text_raw) 

# test to see whether the result is exactly equal to our desired output
assert date_text_standard == normalized_date_text   
</pre>

<p>now run it and...

<p>[screenshot of failed test]</p>

<p>Ta-da! We have written our first failing test.</p>

<p>So now what? Now we find the path of least resistance - the easiest way we can think of to solve the given error. The console suggests that a "normalize_date" function doesn't exist, so let's make one! Over in a new date_normalizer.py file, let's write</p>

<pre class="brush: python; toolbar: false">
def normalize_date(raw_date_text):
    pass
</pre>

<p>[text about this failing, and following the error message]</p>

<pre class="brush: python; toolbar: false">
def normalize_date(raw_date_text):
    return "2014-07-01"
</pre>

<p>There! Ok, that's a little pedantic (the code doesn't actually do anything with the input string, it just cheekily returns the string we want), but it really is important to do these small, path-of-least-resistance edits, especially as we are just learning the concept of TDD. Small, iterative steps are incredibly important when building anything complex - keeps things [].</p>

<p>Now date_normalizer_tests.py needs to know where to find the normalize_date function, so let's add it:</p>

<pre class="brush: python; toolbar: false">
from date_normalizer import normalize_date
</pre>

<p>now we have a completely working test! Except that the code is completely useless. We can easily break it again by writing another simple test:</p>

<pre class="brush: python; toolbar: false">
def test_date_in_american_verbose_standard():
    date_text_raw_2 = "January 5, 1900"
    date_text_standard_2 = "1900-01-05"
    normalized_date_text_2 = normalize_date(date_text_raw_2)
    assert date_text_standard_2 == normalized_date_text_2
</pre>

<p>Now we know we can </p>
