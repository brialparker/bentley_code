<h2>About the Computing Timeline</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>



The History of Computing at the University of Michigan Timeline was created by Alice Goff, graduate student archivist, and Nancy Deromedi, archivist, at the Bentley Historical Library. Earlier research was done by Mary Ann Williams as part of the Archives Practicum (SI 692), Winter 2007. The timeline was updated in 2012 by Elise Reynolds, a graduate student archivist. 
The timeline was developed to highlight the University of Michigan's history of and contributions to computing in order to build an interest in the records in the Bentley's holdings. Researchers can watch our connected, computer-centered world develop as they explore the various collections related to computing. The University of Michigan has been deeply involved in developments in this field and, as a result, it is impossible to feature every event in the history of computing on the timeline. Events were selected carefully, in an effort to represent the major contributions and developments within the context of the broader history of the University. Items on the timeline try to show not only the technology being developed and purchased, but also how it was used across campus and how it changed the way the University functioned. The timeline attempts to show how the role of computing technology has changed across time and how the technologies have changed and developed, but it should always be remembered that only a part of the story can be told through the timeline.

Many sources were consulted in creating the History of Computing Timeline. As more recent events were added, sources became difficult to find because most collections did not have additions beyond the year 2000. For events later than 2000, The University Record and the University News Service records were generally used to obtain information. These records were useful, but contain less detail than other organizational records might provide. Best efforts were made to ensure accuracy of information.
