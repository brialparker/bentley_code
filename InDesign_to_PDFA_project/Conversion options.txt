The issue seems to be with various aspects of the InDesign document's exported XMP metadata (XMP being a metadata format designed by Adobe).

The current workflow is:
	Export InDesign document as a PDF
	Open PDF in AdobeAcrobat, and use its built-in PDF/A converter to create the PDF/A version
		-> This is what is failing

Possible solutions:

	Implement a fix using the Python XMP Toolkit
		Pro: would likely enable a working fix

		Con: dependencies; possibly mac-only
			exempi
			boost

		Con: due to dependencies, would likely restrict use of the fix to our end -- more work for the archivists

	Write an InDesign script
		Pro: easy-ish for contributor to implement

		Cons: Unclear if it can delete XMP data -- certainly it can add it. Would need experimentation.
			  Uses Javascript

	Do a blind find-and-replace on the raw files
		Pro: still a python script, but would have no dependencies other than python

		Con: Unclear if it would work...

Post-meeting resolution

May be a way to make it work just using InDesign
InDesign docs should be exported as Packages
