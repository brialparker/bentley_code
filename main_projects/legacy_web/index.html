        <div id="description">

            <p class="description">
                "Civil War has commenced! The feverish excitement that has so long existed has now, in great part, given
                away to a sensation of horror and intense sorrow at the announcement that the long expected yet dreaded
                storm has burst over Fort Sumter. Alas for our beloved country!!" So wrote an Adrian, MI merchant Adrian
                in his journal on April 13, 1861, reflecting the speed and decisiveness with which the state of Michigan
                responded to the outbreak of the war.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                As the first year passed, with no end of the war in sight and the Northern armies repulsed in almost
                every major engagement, initial enthusiasm for the war was replaced by discouragement. As the tide of
                battle slowly turned through 1863, people rallied from despondency and by the warÂ’s end, the citizens
                of Michigan felt that they had done their whole duty: their cavalrymen were among the most celebrated in
                the Union armies and Michigan regiments, feared by the Rebels, had borne the brunt of many well-fought
                fields and were present in every major encounter.
            </p>

            <p class="description">The Bentley Historical Library has more than 400 collections pertaining to the
                participation of Michigan men and military units in the Civil War as well as the experiences of family
                and friends on the home front. In 2010-2011, the Bentley digitized 157 collections that had been
                previously microfilmed to increase access to these important materials and commemorate the conflict's
                sesquicentennial anniversary. </p>

            <p class="description">
                These collections range in size from a single letter or diary fragment up to multiple folders of letters
                as well as volumes of diaries, notebooks, or reminiscences. The materials furthermore vary greatly in
                degree of literacy, legibility, and content. Diary entries might be brief comments about daily weather
                conditions or detailed descriptions of camp life and battles participated in. The collections of letters
                are strongest for what was going on the war front with less information about activities of those who
                remained behind. All, however, offer an authentic view of the Civil War as it was experienced by the men
                and women of Michigan who lived through the conflict.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                These records and observations are a rich source of information that the historian can find in no other
                place. They record, day by day, all aspects of these experiences from the induction camps, where one
                recruit wrote: "I have got to be a soldier and it is a fine thing," to mustering out and the long
                hoped-for journey home.
